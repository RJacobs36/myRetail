# myRetail

To run the project
1. Clone into favorite IDE.
2. Run Gradle Task "BootRun"
3. Once running, Postman can be used to make a rest call to "http://localhost:8080/products?id=13860428" where the id can be changed to any other valid id to find a product.
  
  Unfortunately things are not working properly and my objects are not being populated properly by the restTemplate.  The results of the rest call are logged in the console, but I was unable to get the results into the objects which I created and therefore return the correct response.
